In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for 
the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and 
Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or 
(case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. 
Otherwise output No.

Hints
No need to convert the user’s input to an int if you check 
for equality with "42", a str, rather than 42, an int!

It’s okay if your output or the user’s wraps onto multiple lines.

How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python deep.py. Type 42 and press Enter. 
Your program should output:
Yes 

Run your program with python deep.py. Type Forty Two and press Enter. 
Your program should output:
Yes

Run your program with python deep.py. Type forty-two and press Enter. 
Your program should output
Yes

Run your program with python deep.py. Type 50 and press Enter. 
Your program should output
No


Be sure to vary the casing of your input and “accidentally” add spaces on 
either side of your input before pressing enter. Your program should behave as 
expected, case- and space-insensitively.
